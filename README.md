# Fixing a current error on the code

So I have found a github repository:

- https://github.com/peduajo/geetest-slice-captcha-solver?tab=readme-ov-file 

that can get you a distance between a board that is missing a puzzle and the missing puzzle:

I have copied the file solver.py from the given link, and added it to my code scraper.py. So my codes gets the two images and saves them, as desbriced in the function solver_captcha_slider. After it has save them (as shown in the next images)

I would like to use the PuzleSolver class from the solver.py to get the distance (under the variable solution) between them, and later on, use that distance to move the missing piece to the board. But when I run the code, I get the following error message: 


File "c:\Users\xxxxx\OneDrive - xxxxx SA\Documents\German site\solver.py", line 17, in get_position
res = cv2.matchTemplate(background, template, cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED)
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
cv2.error: OpenCV(4.9.0) D:\a\opencv-python\opencv-python\opencv\modules\imgproc\src\templmatch.cpp:588: error: (-215:Assertion failed) corr.rows <= img.rows + templ.rows - 1 && corr.cols <= img.cols + templ.cols - 1 in function 'cv::crossCorr'


for the function (in solver.py):


def get_position(self):
        template, x_inf, y_sup, y_inf = self.__piece_preprocessing()
        background = self.__background_preprocessing(y_sup, y_inf)

        res = cv2.matchTemplate(background, template, cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED)
        min_val, max_val, min_loc, max_loc = cv2.minMaxLoc(res)
        top_left = max_loc

        origin = x_inf
        end = top_left[0] + PIXELS_EXTENSION

        return end - origin


How can I fix this issue so that I get the distance between them?

P.S. The puzzle captcha does not appear always, so you will need to run the program a couple of times. I have also asked this question on stackoverflow, so maybe you can see the explanation there as well. Here is the link:

The error you're encountering is related to the cv2.matchTemplate function in OpenCV, indicating that there's an issue with the dimensions of the images you're trying to match. Specifically, the error message:

less
Copy code
cv2.error: OpenCV(4.9.0) D:\a\opencv-python\opencv-python\opencv\modules\imgproc\src\templmatch.cpp:588: error: (-215:Assertion failed) corr.rows <= img.rows + templ.rows - 1 && corr.cols <= img.cols + templ.cols - 1 in function 'cv::crossCorr'
suggests that the size of the template image is larger than the search region in the background image, which is not allowed for the template matching operation. Here's how you can troubleshoot and fix this issue:

1. Validate Image Dimensions
First, ensure that the template image (the puzzle piece) is smaller than the background image (the board) in both width and height. You can print out their dimensions to verify this:

python
Copy code
print("Template dimensions:", template.shape)
print("Background dimensions:", background.shape)
2. Adjust the Preprocessing Functions
If the template ends up being larger, you need to check the preprocessing functions (__piece_preprocessing and __background_preprocessing) to ensure they correctly process the images. The preprocessing should result in a template that is indeed smaller than the background over the region you're searching.

3. Ensure Correct Region of Interest (ROI)
Sometimes, the error can occur if the region of interest (ROI) in the background image that you're searching within is incorrectly defined, making it smaller than the template. Adjust the ROI in the background image to ensure it's larger than the template image.

4. Debugging the Preprocessing
Inspect or debug the preprocessing functions to ensure they return correctly sized images. For instance, ensure that __background_preprocessing(y_sup, y_inf) correctly slices the background image to a larger region than the template.

5. Update OpenCV (Optional)
While not directly related to the error message, ensuring you're using the latest version of OpenCV can help avoid any potential bugs:

bash
Copy code
pip install --upgrade opencv-python
Implementing a Possible Fix
Based on the error description and typical usage of cv2.matchTemplate, here is an example approach to adjust your preprocessing to ensure the template is smaller than the background:

python
Copy code
def get_position(self):
    template, x_inf, y_sup, y_inf = self.__piece_preprocessing()
    background = self.__background_preprocessing(y_sup, y_inf)

    # Ensure the template is smaller than the background
    assert template.shape[0] < background.shape[0] and template.shape[1] < background.shape[1], "Template must be smaller than background"

    res = cv2.matchTemplate(background, template, cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED)
    min_val, max_val, min_loc, max_loc = cv2.minMaxLoc(res)
    top_left = max_loc

    origin = x_inf
    end = top_left[0] + PIXELS_EXTENSION

    return end - origin
By adding an assertion, you can catch cases where the template might be larger than the background, which directly addresses the cause of the error you're encountering. This approach provides a clear error message if the precondition fails, helping you debug the issue more effectively.
